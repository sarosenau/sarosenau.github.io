## About Me

[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]
I am a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in the sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology of the internet. Projects I have worked on or am currently working on include how the TikTok algorithm affects langauge use, English-speaking K-pop fans' use of Korean through Mock Koreaboo, how Orthodox Jewish Pittsburghers use Pittsburghese, and more!
